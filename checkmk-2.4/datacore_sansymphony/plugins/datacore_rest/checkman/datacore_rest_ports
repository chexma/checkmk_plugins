description:
 This check monitors FC (Fibre Channel) and iSCSI ports on a DataCore
 SANsymphony storage server.

 The check monitors:

 - Port connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
 - Port type (FC, iSCSI) and mode (Initiator, Target)
 - Link error counters (CRC errors, link failures, sync losses)
 - HBA information and firmware details
 - Read and write IOPS
 - Read and write throughput

 The check returns {CRIT} if the port is disconnected (configurable),
 and can alert on link error thresholds.

 This check requires the special agent configurable through
 "DataCore SANsymphony via REST API".

item:
 The name (Caption) of the port.

discovery:
 One service is created for each port (excluding loopback ports).
