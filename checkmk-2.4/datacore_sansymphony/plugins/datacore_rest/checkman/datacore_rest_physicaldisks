 storage system. Physical disks are the actual storage devices that
 provide capacity to storage pools.

 The check monitors:

 - Disk online/offline status
 - Read and write IOPS
 - Read and write throughput
 - Read and write latency (configurable thresholds)
 - Read/write ratio

 The check returns {CRIT} if the disk is offline, and {OK} if online.
 Latency thresholds can be configured through WATO rules.

 This check requires the special agent configurable through
 "DataCore SANsymphony via REST API".
