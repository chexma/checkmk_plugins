description:
 This check monitors virtual disks (LUNs) in a DataCore SANsymphony
 storage system. Virtual disks are the storage volumes presented to
 hosts via FC or iSCSI.

 The check monitors:

 - Virtual disk health status (Healthy, Path down, In recovery, etc.)
 - Serving state (whether the disk is mapped to hosts)
 - Write-through mode detection
 - Read and write IOPS (configurable thresholds)
 - Read and write throughput
 - Read/write ratio
 - Allocation percentage
 - Compression, deduplication, and encryption status

 The check returns {CRIT} for unhealthy states or full recovery,
 {WARN} for log recovery, path down (configurable), write-through mode,
 or unmapped disks.

 This check requires the special agent configurable through
 "DataCore SANsymphony via REST API".

item:
 The name (Alias) of the virtual disk.

discovery:
 One service is created for each virtual disk (excluding snapshots).
