description:
 This check monitors the capacity utilization of storage pools in a
 DataCore SANsymphony storage system using filesystem-style thresholds.

 The check supports standard CheckMK filesystem parameters including:

 - Percentage-based warning and critical thresholds
 - Magic factor for dynamic threshold adjustment based on pool size
 - Trend computation for growth rate monitoring
 - Minimum levels for very large pools

 Default thresholds are 80% for {WARN} and 90% for {CRIT}.

 This check requires the special agent configurable through
 "DataCore SANsymphony via REST API".

item:
 The name (Alias) of the storage pool.

discovery:
 One service is created for each storage pool.
